	<h1>It is just a brief idea right now...</h1>

		<p>In 2020 our relatively peaceful life has been strongly impacted by the coming of coronavirus. As a result, we were been 'forced' to live with a very different pattern. To me, the most impressive change is socializing with the videoconferencing App.</p> 
		<p>Although many people treat the video conferencing an alternative way of general socializing, I believe what we achieve now in the area of video communication is way far too able to compare with general socializing; the potential demand from general socializing, such as emotion or even spirit's connection, are impossible to imitate by today's technology. Therefore, I always feel the videoconferencing didn't achieve what I want, as well as it brings exhaustion every time.</p>
		<p>While the coronavirus disaster is still far away to be ended, I feel the influence it brings to us is irreversible. Which means, as some expert believes that the coronavirus will be living with us, the situation that people start to extensively use remote service and videoconference application like Zoom, as well as many people working from home, is also irreversible within a certain rate. After all, we people always move forward but seldomly take a step back.</p>
		<p> There I'm looking to build a web-based videoconference interface to make communication between real-life and online video a better experience. Instead of trying to reach the level of general socializing, I want to divide video communication from general socializing by focusing on the information we want to send to the other side, such as language and emotion, and avoid shortage of videoconferences like video-noise and privacy-leaking.</p>

	<h2>Reducing details</h2>
		<p>One of the main problem that video communication faced is the fatigue occurred because of the losing details from the video and limited vision.</p>
		<p>While it is extremely high cost to conserve quality in a lifetime video, I'm aiming to reduce all the details from it while keep very basic information such as body language, and if possible, a person's mood. Additionally, it also has the advantage that protect people's privacy, which is a key topic for internet users.

	<h2>Bring weather into the environment</h2>
		<p>I had this idea because I want to create a bridge from the internet and real life. Thinking in the future, people who have his/her own reason that cannot go to campus but need to communicate with others, a common topic that can link them up is very important. I think the closest thing is what we can see under the same sky; as we greet in general, "such a good day" is commonly used to had a soft knock on the door of the heart.</p>

	<h2>and the Art?</h2>
		<p>I didn't figured it out yet... It now might seems like a product instead of ark work, but I believe the idea will come during future progress.</p>
